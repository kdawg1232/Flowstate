    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: December 31, 2025</p>
    
    <p>FlowState ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled when you use the FlowState mobile application.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>FlowState is designed as a "local-first" application. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data, health data, or activity history to external servers. All progress, reps, and scores are stored strictly on your device's local storage.</p>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Our app does not use any third-party tracking, analytics, or advertising SDKs. We do not share any data with third parties.</p>

    <h2>3. Account Deletion</h2>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, deleting the app or using the "Delete Account & Data" feature within the app settings will permanently erase all your information. We do not maintain any backups of your data.</p>

    <h2>4. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

    <h2>5. Contact Us</h2>
